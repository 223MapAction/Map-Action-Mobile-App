### **About Map Action**

Map Action is a technological innovation initiated by the consulting firm Kaicedra Consulting SAS, a malian organisation. We specialize in geolocating issues or areas of interest, mapping, monitoring, and providing databases in the fields of environment, WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene), and sustainable development. Our actions involve civil society, governments, NGOs, private or semi-private structures, etc.

In addition to our geolocation and mapping services, Map Action also integrates advanced artificial intelligence technologies. Our system uses machine learning algorithms to automatically detect the types of incidents, assess their severity, and consider potential solutions. Furthermore, we analyze the potential impacts of these incidents on the environment, thus providing valuable insights for decision-making and crisis management.

Our technology-driven and data-centric approach enables us to provide innovative and effective solutions to address the complex challenges faced by our clients. Whether it's natural resource monitoring, disaster management, or sustainable development planning, Map Action is committed to providing cutting-edge tools and analytics to help our partners make a positive impact on our world.
